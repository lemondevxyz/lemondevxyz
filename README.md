- 👋 Hi, I’m @lemondevxyz
- 👀 I’m interested in servers, clients and systems programming. Specifically how to design ✨ beautiful ✨ systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Common Lisp and JavaScript(the node js not the plain old browser js)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that benefits Common Lisp's server or client web ecosystem
- 📫 Reach me through `lemon at lemondev dot xyz`
